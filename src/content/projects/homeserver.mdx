Driven by my passion for home automation, I initiated this project to set up Home Assistant, which has since evolved into a comprehensive home server solution. Using two Raspberry Pi devices, I have implemented a robust infrastructure using Ansible for configuration management and Docker for containerization. This combo makes it super easy to deploy, scale, and manage all sorts of services.

Through this project, I've gotten hands-on experience with automation, monitoring, and network management, using a variety of technologies to create a smooth and integrated home server environment.

I'll be sharing more details about my setup in the near future.
