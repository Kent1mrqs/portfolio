This project was developed for an RTU Cryptography class, I chose WiFi Encryption Simulation to explore the practical application of cryptographic algorithms in network security. This project simulates the process of connecting a device to a WiFi network, including server authentication, encryption (RC4 encryption), and data transfer. The simulation demonstrates the steps involved in establishing a secure connection between a client and a server, with encryption protocols playing a central role in securing communication.
